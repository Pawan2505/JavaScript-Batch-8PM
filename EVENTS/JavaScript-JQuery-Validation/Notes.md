Introduction to jQuery Validation

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Form validation is an essential part of web development. It ensures that the data submitted by a user is in the correct format and meets the application's requirements. jQuery makes form validation easier with the jQuery Validation Plugin.
