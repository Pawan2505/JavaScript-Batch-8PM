 <!-- Inheritance in JavaScript -->

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class (child class) is derived from an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and hierarchical relationships.



<!-- Class Inheritance -->

To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class.
