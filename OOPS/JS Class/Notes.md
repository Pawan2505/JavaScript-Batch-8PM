Blueprint for Objects: Classes are templates for creating objects that share common properties and methods.

Encapsulation: Classes bundle data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on that data into a single structure.

Constructor Method: The constructor method is used to initialize object properties when a new instance is created.

Instance Methods: Functions defined inside a class that can be used by all instances of the class.

Creating Instances: Use the new keyword to create a new object from a class.
