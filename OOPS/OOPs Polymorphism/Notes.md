 <!-- Polymorphism -->

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It means "many shapes" in Greek and enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). 

<!-- There are two types of polymorphism: -->

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Note: JavaScript does not support compile-time polymorphism directly as some other languages do (like Java), but we can achieve run-time polymorphism through method overriding.

2. Method Overriding in JavaScript

In JavaScript, polymorphism is typically implemented through method overriding, where a method in a child class has the same name as a method in its parent class but with different functionality.
